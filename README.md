How to load in a sprite:

Import a sprite from vox2png frames. Preferably have the frames facing the right -> for consistency. This can be done under Image -> Rotate Clockwise/Anti Clockwise when the Image Editor is open. 



If a model has multiple frames each frame will be a separate sprite. Make a folder with the name of the base mode, inside of it import each frame. The first frame should end with "_0" and each frame should sequentially increase.
